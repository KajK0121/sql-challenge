Module 9 Challenge
This is my SQL challenge, this repository contains two SQL files and a ERD diagram. A table was created using quickDBD in order to import data onto pgAdmin4 in order to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. EmployeeSQL contains the coding used to create the tables and QuerySQL shows how our queries were answered.
